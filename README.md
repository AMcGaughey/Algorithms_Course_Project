# Algorithms_Course_Project
CSC 413 Course Project


1. Overview

This program reads the file IntegerArray.txt, which contains 100,000 integers (one per line), counts the total number of inversions using a merge-sort–based algorithm, and outputs:

- The total inversion count
- The runtime of the algorithm
- A sorted version of the array saved as output.txt


2. How to Run the Program
I opened the project in visual studios and ran the program through the applications run button when I had Visual Studios open.
